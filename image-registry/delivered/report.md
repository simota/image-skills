- **Grade every claim**: `measured` names the measurement method or a located,
  repeatable visual observation, not aesthetic certainty. `inspected` is reasoned
  judgement where measurement cannot settle the decision; say why. Header
  inspection is **not viewing pixels**. `asserted` never supports completion:
  the prompt asked for 3:2, it does not report what came back
- **The unit is the decision, not the batch.** Each thing the deliverable
  promised carries a grade or sits in the residuals as `UNSPECIFIED`, and a
  decision in neither is what gets invented at export time by whoever hits it first
- **Report `status`**: `DONE` (every promised decision made, every measurable
  claim measured, zero `UNSPECIFIED`) / `PARTIAL` / `BLOCKED` (say what was tried)
- **Every residual is `BLOCKED` / `OUT-OF-SCOPE` / `DEFERRED` / `UNSPECIFIED`**
  and appears in the handoff's `open`; a run holding `Write` also leaves a
  `#TODO(agent):` marker carrying that class in the document it produced
- **Never omit the sweep** — markers against `open`, promised decisions against
  graded ones: `swept, 0 markers; 6 decisions / 6 graded`. While either pair
  disagrees the status is not `DONE` (`_image/CONTRACT.md`)
